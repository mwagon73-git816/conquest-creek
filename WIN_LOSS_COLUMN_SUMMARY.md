# Win-Loss Column Addition - Summary

## Overview
Added a Win-Loss (W-L) record column to the tournament leaderboard to show each team's wins and losses at a glance.

## Changes Made

### 1. App.jsx - Calculate Wins and Losses ‚úÖ

Updated the `calculateTeamPoints` function to track wins and losses:

**Added Variables:**
```javascript
let matchWins = 0;
let matchLosses = 0;
```

**Counting Logic:**
```javascript
teamMatches.forEach(match => {
  const isTeam1 = match.team1Id === teamId;
  const won = isTeam1 ? match.winner === 'team1' : match.winner === 'team2';

  if (won) {
    matchWins++;  // Count wins
    // ... calculate points
  } else {
    matchLosses++; // Count losses
  }
});
```

**Return Values:**
```javascript
return {
  matchWinPoints,
  matchWins,      // NEW
  matchLosses,    // NEW
  bonusPoints,
  cappedBonus,
  totalPoints: matchWinPoints + cappedBonus,
  setsWon,
  gamesWon,
  matchesPlayed: teamMatches.length
};
```

### 2. Leaderboard.jsx - Display W-L Column ‚úÖ

**Added Table Header:**
```jsx
<th className="text-center p-2">W-L</th>
```

**Added Table Data Cell:**
```jsx
<td className="text-center p-2">{team.matchWins}-{team.matchLosses}</td>
```

**Column Position:**
- Between "Matches" and "Win Pts" columns (as requested)

## Data Accuracy

### Calculation:
- ‚úÖ Counts actual match results (winner field)
- ‚úÖ Wins + Losses = Total Matches Played
- ‚úÖ Automatically updated when matches are added/edited
- ‚úÖ Persists with other match data

### Validation:
The W-L record will always satisfy:
```
matchWins + matchLosses = matchesPlayed
```

## Testing

### Test 1: New Team (No Matches)
- **Expected**: Matches: 0, W-L: 0-0
- **Verify**: Display shows "0-0"

### Test 2: Team with Wins Only
- **Given**: 3 wins, 0 losses
- **Expected**: W-L: 3-0
- **Verify**: Undefeated display

### Test 3: Team with Mix
- **Given**: 5 wins, 3 losses (8 total)
- **Expected**: W-L: 5-3
- **Verify**: Numbers add up to matches played

### Test 4: Team with Losses Only
- **Given**: 0 wins, 4 losses
- **Expected**: W-L: 0-4
- **Verify**: Shows winless record

### Test 5: Column Alignment
- **Verify**: W-L column is between "Matches" and "Win Pts"
- **Verify**: Text is center-aligned
- **Verify**: Format is consistent (e.g., "6-2" not "6 - 2")

## Technical Details

1. Match is saved with winner field
2. `calculateTeamPoints()` counts wins/losses
3. `getLeaderboard()` includes W-L in team object

5. Updates automatically with new matches

### Performance:
- ‚úÖ No additional database queries
- ‚úÖ Calculated once per render
