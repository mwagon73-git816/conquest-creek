Qualifying for the Championship
•  Top 2 Advance: Based on total points (wins + bonuses). No minimum matches required, as bonuses incentivize activity. Ties broken by comparing sets won then if needed, games won.  If still tied, will look at team spirit points.  
Bonus points can be no greater than 25% of match win points.  For example, if a team has 6 points from match wins and 6 points from Bonus points their total score will be 7.5 (6+1.5).  If they win 2 more matches for 8 match win points then they will have access to 2 bonus points (ie., total score 10).
Important: Points received through player trades are not subject to the 25% cap and will be treated as match win points.
•  Merit-Based: Focuses on well-rounded performance.
Reasoning: This ensures the strongest and spirited teams advance, aligning with the tournament’s goals of competition and community.
